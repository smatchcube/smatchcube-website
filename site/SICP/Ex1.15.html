<p>The number of times the <code>sine</code> procedure is applied is \(5\) because \(12.15 (1/3)^4=0.15&gt;0.1\) and \(12.15(1/3)^5=0.05&lt;0.1\) (the angle is divided by \(3\) each time the function is applied). The number of times the <code>sine</code> procedure is applied on an angle \(a\) is the integer \(n\) such that \(a (1/3)^n &lt; 0.1\) and the solution is the logarithm of \(0.1/a\) in base \(1/3\) (the answer is the ceiling of that logarithm to be exact). So this procedure has an order of growth of \((_{1/3}{(3)} )\) in time if I'm not wrong.</p>
<p>As explain later in the book, it's quite useless to have a really precise idea of the order of growth so we can simply say that the order of growth in time of the <code>sine</code> procedure is \(((n))\). The order of growth in space is \((n)\).</p>
