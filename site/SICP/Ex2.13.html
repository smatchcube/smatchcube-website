<p>Let's take two intervals defined by their center and percentage tolerance: - interval \(A\) with center \(c_1\) and percentage \(p_2\) - interval \(B\) with center \(c_2\) and percentage \(p_2\)</p>
<p>We can easily find the lower bound and upper bound of each interval using the ideas of the <code>make-center-percent</code> procedure defined in the previous exercise:</p>
<p>\(A=(c_1-,c_1+)B=(c_2-,c_2+)\)</p>
<p>Assuming that the bounds are positives (as proposed by the exercise), we can determine the product of the two intervals :</p>
<p>\(A.B=((c_1-)(c_2-),(c_1+)(c_2+))\)</p>
<p>\(\ \ \ \ =(c_1c_2+--,c_1c_2+++)\)</p>
<p>Now we can easily see the center and the with of our new interval.\ Next we can evaluate the percentage of our new interval following the ideas of our <code>percent</code> procedure:\ \[(AB)=\] You can verify that this percentage is correct with substitution using the <code>percent</code> procedure.</p>
<p>If the percentages \(p_1\) and \(p_2\) are small then \(\) is negligible and we get: \[(AB)p_1p_2\]</p>
<p>We just proved that the percentage tolerance of the product of two intervals is approximately the sum of the two percentage tolerance of the factors if these percentages are small.</p>
