<p><strong>Note</strong> : <em>my solution may be extremely wrong as comparing the times doesn't give expected ratios, maybe because the <code>safe?</code> procedure takes more time when as the number of queens on the board increase. This question is not trivial. My analyze may not be 100% false though, <code>queen-cols</code> is called too many times.</em></p>
<p>The original <code>queens</code> procedure calls <code>queen-cols</code> only \(n+1\) times. Louis's procedure calls the <code>queen-cols</code> procedure for both each <code>new-row</code> and each column, hence for a board of size \(n\) the procedure <code>queen-cols</code> is called \(n^n\) times in contrary to only \(n+1\) times from the original procedure.\ So if the original procedure solves the puzzle in time \(T\), Louis's procedure may solves the puzzle in approximately time \(T^T\).</p>
