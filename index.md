# Programming  üë®‚Äçüíª

Here are my own solutions for some popular programming and computer science books or courses:

* [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (WIP)](SICP.html)
* [C Primer Plus (6^th^ edition)](CPP.html)
* [CIS 194: Introduction to Haskell](https://github.com/Smatchcube/CIS-194-Spring-13)

Here are some programs I made:

* [A simple sudoku solver using a backtracking algorithm](programs/sudoku_solver.html)
* [Ultimate tic-tac-toe, a variant of a classic game](https://github.com/smatchcube/ultimate-tic-tac-toe)

I also like solving some Project Euler problems:
