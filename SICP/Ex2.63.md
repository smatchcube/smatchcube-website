# a.
Both procedures return an ordered list with every entry of the tree so for the example of the figure 2.16 the list returned would be `(1 3 5 7 9 11)`.
# b.
Both procedures need to run on each node so they both required $n$ steps. Though the first procedure use frequently the `append` procedure which is not really fast that's why the second procedure is better.
